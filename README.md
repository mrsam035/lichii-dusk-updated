# Lichii

Lichii is an experimental, open-source Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 emulator written in C++. It builds on Eglantine, Eden, yuzu and Sudachi, preserving their contributions while developing this fork's game compatibility and renderer fixes.

This is an independent fork, not an official release of those upstream projects. Lichii is not affiliated with Nintendo.

Visit the [Lichii game compatibility website](https://lichii.zortos.me) to find games and compare community compatibility reports.

## Downloads and setup

Download Lichii only from this repository's [releases page](https://github.com/zortos293/Lichii/releases). Lichii has no other download site: archives offered elsewhere, such as lichii.org, are not built by this project, and one has been reported to install malware ([#545](https://github.com/zortos293/Lichii/issues/545)).

On Windows, extract the entire build archive and run **lichii.exe**. Only use games and system files you have legally obtained. Games, keys and firmware are not included.

### Existing saves and settings

Lichii uses its own profile: `%APPDATA%\lichii` on Windows, and the `lichii` directories under `$XDG_DATA_HOME`, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` on Linux and macOS. Without XDG overrides, these are `~/.local/share/lichii`, `~/.config/lichii` and `~/.cache/lichii`. An existing portable `user/` directory still takes priority and is not imported or changed by the wizard.

On the first non-portable GUI launch, Lichii offers to import Eden and other detected emulator profiles. Back up `%APPDATA%\eden` first on Windows, or the old data, config and cache directories on Unix, and close the source emulator. Choose **Keep Old Data** to copy without changing the source, then check your saves and relaunch. Existing destination data is retained in backup directories rather than merged. Move also retains a source backup until you remove it yourself; Link deliberately shares settings and saves. Paths outside the imported data root remain shared and unchanged. An interrupted import offers recovery on the next launch. `eden-cli`, including `--help` and `--version`, refuses to initialize configuration until you import or explicitly choose **Start fresh** in the GUI.

## The Duskbloods Network Test (playDB-CNT integration)

This integration branch also preserves the Duskbloods-specific changes from the older Lichii-Duskbloods fork. It is a community-maintained build on top of the current `nx2` branch; it is not an official upstream Lichii release and is not affiliated with Nintendo or FromSoftware.

The online test uses the community [playDB-CNT launcher](https://github.com/sikoGD/playDB-CNT), which starts the emulator with the local network-test server configuration.

### Requirements

- A legally obtained copy of *The Duskbloods Network Test* and the Switch 2 system files required by Lichii.
- Windows 10/11 x64 for the supplied playDB-CNT launcher.
- The [playDB-CNT launcher](https://github.com/sikoGD/playDB-CNT), configured according to its own documentation.

### Launching the Network Test

1. Extract the integration build to a short, writable folder, for example `C:\\Games\\Lichii-Duskbloods\\`.
2. Install your own decryption keys and firmware using Lichii's **Tools** menu.
3. Configure `launcher_settings.json` in playDB-CNT so that `emulator` points to this build's `lichii.exe` and `game` points to your Network Test game folder. For example:

   ```json
   {
     "emulator": "C:\\Games\\Lichii-Duskbloods\\lichii.exe",
     "game": "C:\\Games\\THE DUSKBLOODS NETWORK TEST"
   }
   ```

4. Start `Play.Duskbloods.exe` and launch the game from the launcher. Do not start the Network Test directly from `lichii.exe`: the launcher supplies the local online-test configuration required by the game.

### Preserved Duskbloods-specific changes

- playDB-CNT online integration, including launcher-driven host redirection, loopback-only networking controls, and trust for the launcher's local test certificate.
- Duskbloods-specific BCAT handling.
- Native shader translation fixes and stack-related shader handling.
- Vulkan fixes for layered fog-volume clears and the neural-upscaler scratch-buffer clear.
- Faster GPU-memory subrange lookup and the fork's Duskbloods performance controls.

Some of these fixes have since been implemented or superseded in upstream `nx2`; this branch keeps the newer upstream implementation instead of blindly reapplying an older patch. The compatibility and performance of the Network Test can still vary with the game build, system files, GPU driver and launcher configuration. No game files, keys or firmware are included.

## Compatibility and issue reports

Compatibility and performance vary by game, hardware and driver. Rendering errors, stutters and crashes remain possible. Passing automated tests does not establish that a game renders correctly, and this project makes no universal frame-rate guarantee.

Browse [community compatibility reports](https://lichii.zortos.me/reports) for results with each player's build and setup.

Desktop reporting requires a build containing [PR #303](https://github.com/zortos293/Lichii/pull/303) and is not available in build 88. In builds that include it, play and stop a Switch 2 game, then right-click that game and choose **Submit compatibility report**. Only the latest session in the current Lichii process is eligible.

Confirm the matching website catalog entry and review the editable machine, game, setup, and enabled add-on details prefilled where available. Check the public preview and give explicit consent before submitting. Nothing uploads automatically, and the native v1 reporter does not read or upload logs or files.

When [reporting an issue](https://github.com/zortos293/Eglantine/issues), include:

- The exact build, game version, CPU, GPU and driver version.
- Relevant settings and steps to reproduce the problem.
- A screenshot and the log from the affected session, after checking it for personal information.

Do not upload game files, keys, firmware or private account information.

## Building and contributing

See the [build guide](docs/Build.md), [user documentation](docs/user/README.md) and [coding guidelines](docs/Coding.md). Some inherited documentation and internal build target names still use upstream names. The GUI build target remains `yuzu`; its output is `lichii.exe` on Windows and `lichii` on other desktop platforms.

Keep changes focused and distinguish code-level checks from actual gameplay testing.

## Artwork
Art created by YOB (yobslab)
The supplied Lichii logo, icon and library artwork are in [dist/branding](dist/branding). Windows, Linux and macOS icon resources are generated from that artwork by [Generate-LichiiIcons.ps1](tools/Generate-LichiiIcons.ps1).
